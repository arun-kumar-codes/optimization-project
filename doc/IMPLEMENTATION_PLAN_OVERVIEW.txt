OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN OVERVIEW
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Build a comprehensive test case optimization system that:
- Merges similar test cases to preserve coverage
- Uses AI to create optimized test cases
- Maintains step-level and flow-level coverage
- Generates new optimized test cases (not just filtering)
- Preserves all metadata structure
- Produces output files ready for use

APPROACH:
---------
Instead of just removing duplicate test cases, the system will:
1. Identify similar test cases
2. Merge them to preserve all unique steps
3. Use AI to optimize merged test cases
4. Create new optimized test cases with new IDs
5. Maintain 100% coverage of all original steps
6. Generate output files with exact structure

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
================================================================================

STEP 1: Create Step-Level Uniqueness Analyzer
File: doc/step_01_step_uniqueness_analyzer.txt
- Identify unique steps in each test case
- Compare steps between test cases
- Calculate uniqueness scores
- Generate uniqueness reports

STEP 2: Create Step-Level Coverage Tracker
File: doc/step_02_step_coverage_tracker.txt
- Track which steps are covered across test suite
- Build step coverage map
- Calculate step coverage percentage
- Validate step coverage maintained

STEP 3: Enhance Optimization Engine

- Fix near duplicate removal (add coverage check)
- Fix highly similar removal (check each individually)
- Integrate step-level checks
- Add step-level validation

STEP 4: Implement Merging Functionality
File: doc/step_04_implement_merging.txt
